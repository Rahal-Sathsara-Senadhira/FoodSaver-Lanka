## Setup Instructions

1. **Run the database setup script:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute create_delivery_tables.sql in MySQL Workbench
   ```

2. **Start the Ballerina application:**
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   bal run
   ```

3. **Test the endpoints using Postman or curl**

## Sample Data

The setup script includes sample delivery drivers:
- John Smith (Bike)
- Sarah Johnson (Car)
- Mike Wilson (Van)
- Emma Davis (Bike)
- Alex Brown (Car)

## Error Handling

- All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Database errors are logged and user-friendly messages returned
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Driver availability is automatically managed

## Security Considerations

- Driver phone numbers and emails are protected
- Location data is only accessible to authorized users
- Delivery status updates require proper authentication
- License numbers are validated for uniqueness
